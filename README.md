## ICON Sections in PYthon
[`iconspy`](https://github.com/fraserwg/iconspy) is a python package for constructing sections on the [ICON model's](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-model) native grid.
It offers the ability to create sections that approximate great circles, follow lines of constant latitude or longitude,
and follow contours of an arbitrary field.

The functionality builds upon that provided  by the [`pyicon`](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/m300602/pyicon) package;
however, `iconspy` offers some extra functionality â€”
in particular the ability to join together multiple sections and construct sections which follow contours.
